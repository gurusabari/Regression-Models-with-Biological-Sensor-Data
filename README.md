# Regression-Models-with-Biological-Sensor-Data
In this problem, the task is to predict the current health (as given by the target variable) of an organism
given the measurements from two biological sensors measuring their bio-markers (negative indicates
that it is lesser than the average case). With this data, you are expected to try our linear regression
models on the training data and report the following metrics on the test split: (a) Mean Squared Error,
(b) Mean Absolute Error.
Dataset: In Folder Shared look for file p1-train.csv to train the model and p1-test.csv to test the
model. Last column is the target value.
Models to use: Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression (Use this for the regression problem)
